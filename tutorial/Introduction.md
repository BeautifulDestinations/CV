# Introduction to CV library

CV library provides Haskell bindings for opencv machine vision library. The CV bindings
are currently used internally by the Machine Vision laboratory in the department of
Mathematical Information Technology at the University of Jyväskylä.

Currently this set of bindings and tools is used for actual machine vision problems
and tasks, but due to the small set of people using them, it takes time to smooth
all the rough edges. However, we would be happy to provide help and fixes for anyone
daring enough to use our libraries.

Please **contact** us through the main author Ville Tirronen <ville.tirronen@jyu.fi>
or submit a **bug report** at https://github.com/aleator/CV/issues .

# Building the CV Library

To build this library you need to first install the opencv machine vision library, which
can be obtained at http://opencv.willowgarage.com or through your systems package manager.

Possible build problems are documented at the page [BuildProblems].
