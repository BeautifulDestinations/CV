About 
=====

This is a machine vision package that wraps some functionality of OpenCV
library. This package has been developed for personal use and is not meant to
be a complete wrapper. It also includes some things not in OpenCV.  .
Currently this package is quite dirty and requires much work on documentation
and code clean-up, but is somewhat tested.  The scarce Documentation is
available at <http://users.jyu.fi/~aleator/CV-0.3.0.2/html/index.html> 

Changelog
---------

 *  0.3.0.2 - Workaround for compiling with OS X 10.6 & fixed errors
              about M_PI .
